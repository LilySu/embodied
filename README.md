## 🌟 Overview
Women spend **$200–500/month** on wellness but are drowning in data with zero clarity. **EMBODIED** is a mission-driven "Longevity OS" designed to move women—specifically those navigating pre- and post-menopause—from data overwhelm to vitality-driven action.

We aggregate health data from Oura, Apple Health, lab results, and movement tracking into **ONE Longevity Score (0-100)** based on a tested, real-life framework for holistic wellness.

### The Problem
* **Data Fatigue:** Too many apps, too many metrics, zero direction.
* **Fitness Culture Mismatch:** High-intensity "CrossFit" styles don't serve the 45–55+ demographic.
* **Isolation:** Health journeys are harder to sustain alone.

### The Solution: The "3-Pillar" Model
1.  🎯 **STRAVA (Social Accountability):** Track your Longevity Score and celebrate progress.
2.  🤖 **AI COACHING (Personalized):** Our AI identifies your weakest pillar and gives you exactly **ONE** specific action.
3.  💕 **DATING APPS (Smart Matching):** Accountability partners matched by **commitment level**, not just age or fitness.
